1. # Define a class named Car
class Car:
    # This function runs automatically when we create a new Car object
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):

        print("Car Details:")
        print("Make:", self.make)
        print("Model:", self.model)
        print("Year:", self.year)


# Example
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)

# Calling the method to show the car details
my_car.display_details()


2.# Define a class named Rectangle
class Rectangle:
    # Constructor to initialize the length and breadth of the rectangle
    def __init__(self, length, breadth):
        self.length = length      
        self.breadth = breadth    

    # Method to calculate the area of the rectangle

# Create an object of the Rectangle class
rect1 = Rectangle(10, 5)

# Calculate area and perimeter using the class methods

perimeter = rect1.calculate_perimeter()

# Display 
print("Rectangle Details:")
print("Length:", rect1.length)
print("Breadth:", rect1.breadth)
print("Area:", area)
print("Perimeter:", perimeter)


3. # Base class 
class Animal:
    # Method to represent a general animal sound
    def speak(self):
        print("The animal makes a sound.")

# Child class that inherits from Animal
class Dog(Animal):
    # Overriding the speak() method of the parent class
    def speak(self):
        print("Woof!")
# Create an object of the derived class Dog
my_dog = Dog()

# Call the speak() method
my_dog.speak()


4. # This program shows Encapsulation using a class called Employee
# Create a class named Employee
class Employee:
    # This runs when we make a new Employee object
    def __init__(self, salary):
        # __salary is a private variable (hidden from outside)
        self.__salary = salary

    # This function (getter) is used to see the salary

        return self.__salary

    # This function (setter) is used to change the salary
    def set_salary(self, new_salary):
        # Check if new salary is positive
        if new_salary > 0:
            self.__salary = new_salary
        else:
            print("Salary must be a positive number.")

# Make an Employee object with salary 50000
emp1 = Employee(50000)

# Try to see the private salary directly (this will not work)
try:
    print(emp1.__salary)  #Error because __salary is private
except AttributeError:
    print("You cannot access __salary directly!")

# See the salary using getter method
print("Current Salary:", emp1.get_salary())

# Change the salary using setter method
emp1.set_salary(60000)

# Show the updated salary
print("Updated Salary:", emp1.get_salary())


5. # This program shows Multiple Inheritance in Python
# There are two parent classes (A and B) and one child class (C)
# First parent class
class A:
    # greet() method in class A
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from class A!")

# Second parent class
class B:
    # greet() method in class B
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from class B!")

# Child class that inherits from both A and B
class C(A, B):
    pass  # 'pass' means no new code here, it just inherits everything

# Create an object of class C
obj = C()

# Call the greet() method
obj.greet()


6.# This program demonstrates Abstract Classes in Python
# Shape is an abstract class with an abstract method area()
# Circle and Square inherit from Shape and implement area()

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod  # Import ABC module for abstract classes
import math

# Abstract class
class Shape(ABC):
    # Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass  # No implementation here

# Circle class inherits from Shape
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius  # Store the radius

    # Override area method for Circle
    def area(self):
        return math.pi * self.radius ** 2

# Square class inherits from Shape
class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, side):
        self.side = side  # Store the side length

    # Override area method for Square
    def area(self):
        return self.side * self.side

# Create objects of Circle and Square
circle1 = Circle(5)  # Radius = 5
square1 = Square(4)  # Side = 4

# Print areas
print("Area of Circle:", circle1.area())
print("Area of Square:", square1.area())


7. # This program demonstrates the use of class variables in Python
# It counts how many objects of the Counter class have been created

# Define the Counter class
class Counter:
    # Class variable shared by all objects
    count = 0

    # Constructor runs every time a new object is created
    def __init__(self):
        # Increment the class variable count by 1
        Counter.count += 1

    # Method to display current count
    @classmethod
    def display_count(cls):
        print("Number of Counter objects created:", cls.count)

# Create multiple objects
c1 = Counter()
c2 = Counter()
c3 = Counter()

# Display the count using the class method
Counter.display_count()
